<h2 id="label-Headings">Headings<span><a href="#label-Headings">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>You should not use headings beyond level 3, it is a sign of poor organization of your code or documentation.  It also becomes difficult for the user to figure out what you are attempting to explain to them as they have to track the multiple layers of nesting.</p>

<h1 id="label-Heading+level+1">Heading level 1<span><a href="#label-Heading+level+1">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Above is a level one heading.</p>

<p>These paragraphs are filler that exist so you can see how the heading interacts with paragraphs before and after the heading.  As you can see each different heading has a different amount of margin above and below.</p>

<p>This should be sufficient to give you a proper picture of how it will appear in your documentation.</p>

<h2 id="label-Heading+level+2">Heading level 2<span><a href="#label-Heading+level+2">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Above is a level two heading.</p>

<p>These paragraphs are filler that exist so you can see how the heading interacts with paragraphs before and after the heading.  As you can see each different heading has a different amount of margin above and below.</p>

<p>This should be sufficient to give you a proper picture of how it will appear in your documentation.</p>

<h3 id="label-Heading+level+3">Heading level 3<span><a href="#label-Heading+level+3">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Above is a level three heading.</p>

<p>These paragraphs are filler that exist so you can see how the heading interacts with paragraphs before and after the heading.  As you can see each different heading has a different amount of margin above and below.</p>

<p>This should be sufficient to give you a proper picture of how it will appear in your documentation.</p>

<h4 id="label-Heading+level+4">Heading level 4<span><a href="#label-Heading+level+4">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h4>

<p>Above is a level four heading.</p>

<p>These paragraphs are filler that exist so you can see how the heading interacts with paragraphs before and after the heading.  As you can see each different heading has a different amount of margin above and below.</p>

<p>This should be sufficient to give you a proper picture of how it will appear in your documentation.</p>

<h5 id="label-Heading+level+5">Heading level 5<span><a href="#label-Heading+level+5">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h5>

<p>Above is a level five heading.</p>

<p>These paragraphs are filler that exist so you can see how the heading interacts with paragraphs before and after the heading.  As you can see each different heading has a different amount of margin above and below.</p>

<p>This should be sufficient to give you a proper picture of how it will appear in your documentation.</p>

<h6 id="label-Heading+level+6">Heading level 6<span><a href="#label-Heading+level+6">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h6>

<p>Above is a level six heading.</p>

<p>These paragraphs are filler that exist so you can see how the heading interacts with paragraphs before and after the heading.  As you can see each different heading has a different amount of margin above and below.</p>

<p>This should be sufficient to give you a proper picture of how it will appear in your documentation.</p>

<h2 id="label-Paragraphs">Paragraphs<span><a href="#label-Paragraphs">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>This is how a paragraph looks.  Since it is difficult to generate good content for paragraphs I have chosen to use <a href="http://rikeripsum.com">Riker Ipsum</a> for nonsense filler content.  In the previous sentence you can see how a link is formatted.</p>

<p>Here is an example of <strong>bold</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> styling.  Try not to combine the two or use them too often.  Here is an example of <code>inline verbatim text</code>.  That should be enough of a taste of inline markup in paragraphs. The Riker Ipsum filler follows:</p>

<p>Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Well, I’ll say this for him - he’s sure of himself. and attack the Romulans. Worf, It’s better than music. It’s jazz. This should be interesting. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence.</p>

<p>Sorry, Data. I think you’ve let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Your shields were failing, sir.</p>

<h2 id="label-Verbatim+sections">Verbatim sections<span><a href="#label-Verbatim+sections">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>A verbatim section typically contains source code or example output.  This is how verbatim blocks of code looks:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier ruby-title">local</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">responder</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">responder</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">ping</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">value</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">return</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">value</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier ruby-title">ping</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">uri</span>
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@uri</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">uri</span>
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@remote</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">DRb</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">DRbObject</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">new_with_uri</span> <span class="ruby-ivar">@uri</span>

  <span class="ruby-ivar">@remote</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">ping</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">value</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">return</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">value</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>This is a paragraph following the verbatim block so you can see how leading and trailing paragraphs interact with it.</p>

<h2 id="label-Unordered+lists">Unordered lists<span><a href="#label-Unordered+lists">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Here is an unordered list.  As you can see it uses non-numeral markers for each list item:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>This is the top-most item in the list.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This is a second item in the list.</p>

<p>Unlike the first item, this item has more than one paragraph so you can see how they interact.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This is a third item in the list.  Like the item before it, this item has a second paragraph.</p>

<p>Here is the second paragraph in the list item.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A final list item.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Ordered+lists">Ordered lists<span><a href="#label-Ordered+lists">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Here is an ordered list.  As you can see it uses numeral markers for each list item:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>This is the first item in the list.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This is the second item in the list.</p>

<p>Unlike the first item, this item has more than one paragraph so you can see how they interact.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This is the third item in the list.  Like the item before it, this item has a second paragraph.</p>

<p>Here is the second paragraph in the third list item.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The fourth and final list item.</p>
</li></ol>

<h2 id="label-Definition+lists">Definition lists<span><a href="#label-Definition+lists">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<h3 id="label-22Note-22+list">“Note” list<span><a href="#label-22Note-22+list">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The “note” syntax can be used to create a definition list:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">note</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">description</span>
</pre>

<p>Here is such a definition list:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list note-list"><dt>cat
<dd>
<p>A cat is a small mammal that is commonly kept as a pet.</p>
</dd><dt>dog
<dd>
<p>A dog is a mammal that is also kept as a pet.  A dog may range in size from smaller than a cat to larger than a human.</p>

<p>Typically dogs are easier to train to respond to commands than cats.</p>
</dd><dt>rabbit
<dd>
<p>Rabbits are also mammals, but are infrequently kept as pets.  Most rabbits are wild.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-22Label-22+list">“Label” list<span><a href="#label-22Label-22+list">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The “label” syntax can be used to create a definition list:</p>

<pre class="ruby">[<span class="ruby-identifier">label</span>]
  <span class="ruby-identifier">description</span>
</pre>

<p>Here is such a definition list:</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>cat
<dd>
<p>A cat is a small mammal that is commonly kept as a pet.</p>
</dd><dt>dog
<dd>
<p>A dog is a mammal that is also kept as a pet.  A dog may range in size from smaller than a cat to larger than a human.</p>

<p>Typically dogs are easier to train to respond to commands than cats.</p>
</dd><dt>rabbit
<dd>
<p>Rabbits are also mammals, but are infrequently kept as pets.  Most rabbits are wild.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h2 id="label-Rule">Rule<span><a href="#label-Rule">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>A rule is a horizontal divider between two paragraphs.  Following this paragraph is a rule.</p>
<hr>

<p>In historic versions of <a href="RDoc.html"><code>RDoc</code></a> you could control the height of the rule in HTML output.  This is no longer true as HTML 5 does not support this.</p>
